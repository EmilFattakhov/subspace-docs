## The only tools needed to get you started

The Quick Start is designed with the presumption that you are  not a novice developer, and have some basic understanding or experience. The Quick Start also anticipates that you seek a straightforward initiation into setting up a remote development environment. 
Subspace utilizes EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) so any tools available for Ethereum development works the same way with Subspace. 

### Setup a Metamask Wallet (or any other EVM compatible wallet) and connect it to our custom EVM

```
Network Name: Subspace EVM
New RPC URL: https://eu-2.evm.gemini-3d.subspace.network/ws
Chain ID: 1002
Currency Symbol: TSSC
```

### Get dev tokens to your wallet using our faucet

### Test and deploy your smart contract

You can use **[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)**, **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)** or any other tool familiar to you for testing and deploying your smart contracts. Just make sure to use our custom EVM domain and you're all set. 
If anything above sound unfamiliar, you can always fall back to our full guide.
