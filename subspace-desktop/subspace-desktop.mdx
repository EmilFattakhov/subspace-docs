1. Download and install the latest for your preferred platform from above.
2. Open `subspace-desktop` application.

3. Click the `This is my first time farming` option (or, if you want to use an existing reward address, click `I've run a farmer before and still have my keys`).

4. Select how much space you want to pledge
<img src={require('@site/static/img/subspace-desktop-images/subspace-desktop-plot-size.png').default} />

5. When you click `start plotting`, it may prompt you to store your seed phrase, if you did not import a reward address.

6. The network will begin to sync and plotting will start.

## How to Upgrade
---

### Upgrade from previous version of Subspace Desktop

:::tip UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE IN THE RELEASE NOTES:
- You don't need to delete your existing plot
- You don't need to create a new identity
- You don't need to delete the config and log files
:::

1. Uninstall the old application from your computer
2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/subspace/subspace-desktop/releases) for your preferred platform (make sure to select "Latest" release with green label and not "Pre-release")
3. Install new version of Subspace Desktop
4. Run the application, it should detect your old plot and continue farming as usual

### Wipe & Purge Existing Install

:::caution
This should only be done if you are facing issues, wish to replot, or is required in an update. 
:::

To wipe and purge your plot & node configuration is very simple in Subspace Desktop
1. Open the application
2. Click the "`Settings Gear`" in the top right
3. Click `Reset Node!`
4. You will get a popup which says "`This will erase everything, and you will have to start from the beginning. Only do this if there is something wrong with the network, or you imported a wrong reward address.`"
5. Click the final `Reset`

### Upgrade to GUI from CLI (subspace-node + subspace-farmer)

:::tip Note:
These instructions are for upgrading installation that followed [official guide](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/blob/main/docs/farming.md),
if you followed unofficial one, ask guide author for proper upgrade steps.
:::

1. Remove old data to free space used by CLI:
    ```bash
    # Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
    ./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe
    # Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
    ./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain testnet
    ```
2. Delete those files `FARMER_FILE_NAME` and `NODE_FILE_NAME`
3. Install Subspace Desktop
4. Choose `I've run a farmer before and still have my keys` on the first screen and use the same reward address (that you used for CLI) there

## Development
---
If you would like to use the Developer version of Subspace Desktop, please follow the instructions below.
### Prerequisites

- nodejs 14+
- yarn
- rustc

#### Linux

On Linux you'll have to install development version of `libwebkit2gtk-4.0` and `libappindicator` packages, which can be done on Ubuntu with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libappindicator3-dev \
    patchelf \
    librsvg2-dev
```

- libappindicator: needed to use the system tray feature.
- patchelf and librsvg: needed to bundle AppImage.
